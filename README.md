Welcome to Growthcraft Trapper. This Minecraft mod adds the skill of trapping to the game. This was originally included in the Growthcraft series, however, do to requests we have moved it its own stand alone mod. This will also allow us to be able to maintain and update it quicker. It all started with a simple over-powered block called the Fishtrap. Now that it is its own mod, we are extending it to more than just fish.
